Ear training application for II-V-I progressions used in jazz.

This is a primitive http/js application, currently hosted at:

    http://users.itia.ntua.gr/soulman/eartraining/

Which was very useful for my jazz studies :-). Hope it may be of
general usefulness / interest and can help you as well.

Chords voicing is up to the 7th, see VOICINGS file for more info.
