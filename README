Ear training application for II-V-I cadences used in jazz.

This is a primitive http/js application, currently hosted at:

    http://users.itia.ntua.gr/soulman/eartraining/

Which was very useful for my jazz studies :-). Hope it may be of
general usefulness / interest and can help you as well.

Chords voicing is up to the 7th, 1-3-7/7-1-3 for left hand,
3-5-7 / 7-1-3 / 3-5-7 for right hand.

Special Thanks to my piano teacher George Micros for his artistic
and technical attribution and consultancy and for inspiring for
similar computer and musical projects :-)

You may copy files to use the application locally or host it in some
server, it is a client application, requires no code executed
server-side.
